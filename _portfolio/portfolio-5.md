* Analyzed the effect of different feature engineering and dimensionality adjustment techniques (performed on the UCI's mushroom dataset) on the performance of various Machine Learning models.
* Pre-processing included feature engineering by **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** method and dimensionality reduction of _173 different species of 61,069 mushrooms_ using **Univariate Feature Selection** and **Principal Component Analysis**.

* Five Machine Learning models were implemented- **Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Multilayer Perceptron**.
* Cross-validation was performed on the models, and the optimal model for mushroom classification was selected based on the best performance.
