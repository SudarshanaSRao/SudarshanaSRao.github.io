* Used **OpenCV2** library to build an automated system to detect and recognize traffic lights for an autonomous car.
* **Hough Gradient Descent** was used to train the model, and **Hough Circles** were drawn around the detected traffic light.
* **IR sensor** (interfaced with an **Arduino Uno board**) was used to monitor the distance between the autonomous car and nearby obstacles or traffic.
* The system was live-tested on the streets of Bangalore, and excellent results were achieved.
