* Developed three classes of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models using the PyTorch framework to translate American Sign Language (Kaggle dataset) into a text-based representation.

* First class was a single generic **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** network.
* Second class was two untrained **CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)**- a baseline CNN and a custom CNN (with Adam optimizer and L2 regularization).
* Third class was used to leverage **Transfer Learning** with two pre-trained CNNs- **GoogLeNet** and **ResNet18** networks.
* All five models were tested using images captured in real-time and achieved an accuracy of above **90%**.
