* Identified important cells among the dataset and ranked in a hierarchy using **k-means clustering** and **Logistic Regression**.  
* The dataset comprised 2169 cells taken from the neocortex region of a rat's brain and distributed in 20,000 columns. **Principal Component Analysis** was used to reduce 20,000 columns to 3-5 components.
* Visualized the output data through a dynamic 3-D graph using **Plotly**.
