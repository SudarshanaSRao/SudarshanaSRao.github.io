_{August 2024-Present}_
* Researching and implementing **LLM** use cases in **Data Analytics**.   

_{May 2023-August 2024}_
* Researched and analyzed human interaction with an AI (Nobu) to improve its Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).  
* Managed the interaction sessions (data collection) by assigning participants to the respective time slots.
* Project: Speech quality assessment for automatic speech recognition, which **Disney** sponsors.

_{October 2022-May 2023}_
* Worked at the **S**ignal **A**nalysis and **I**nterpretation **L**aboratory (**SAIL** under the **SIPI**- **S**ignal and **I**mage **P**rocessing **I**nstitute) to annotate audio files.    
* These annotations will train a Machine Learning model to identify, classify, and filter out the noise in recorded conversations.
* This project was funded by **Apple** and appeared at the Interspeech 2023 conference under the research paper title- "Understanding Spoken Language Development of Children with ASD Using Pre-trained Speech Embeddings".
